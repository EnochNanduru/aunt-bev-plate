# Aunt Bev's Kintsugi Plate

This repository hosts a single-page site that documents the restoration
of a beloved Talavera plate using Kintsugi. It is built with plain HTML,
Tailwind CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

## Live Demo
Visit https://enochnanduru.github.io/aunt-bev-plate/

## Features
- Step-by-step breakdown of the repair process with photos
- Before/after slider comparing the broken and restored plate
- Lightbox image viewer
- Optional Google Gemini API integration for reflective and imaginative text
- Smooth scrolling, reveal animations and responsive layout

## Running Locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

No build tools or server are required.

## Enabling the Gemini API
To try the reflection or imagination features you need a Gemini API key.
1. Get a key from Google
2. Open `index.html` and find `GEMINI_API_KEY` near the bottom
3. Paste your key between the quotes and save

With a key, the buttons call the API. Without one, they remain inactive.

## Credits
Photos and text are included for demonstration.
Feel free to adapt the project for your own Kintsugi adventures.
